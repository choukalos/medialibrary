# Media Library

## Description

Quick and dirty media library project to learn fuelphp.  A simple media library project that will use FFMPEG to scan and generate thumbnails for video files.  The thumbnails are used to display in an HTML5 grid.  HTML 5 video streaming ( click on a thumbnail to stream the video ).

## Issues

* does not stream html5 video
** would like it to stream from non web directories - doesnt seem to work
* does not do tagging
* does not search on tagging
* does not look up IMDB
* should have config info in a central config file - don't know how to do that in fuelphp
